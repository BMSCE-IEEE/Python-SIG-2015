Hello world in Python and compared to other programming languages
Python 2 vs 3; why Python 2
(PYA) What is code? Code as written for humans and run on computers as opposed to computers only
(PYA) Everything is a object
(PYA) Python implementations; CPython – C heritage, eg using number as boolean
What makes Python different: dynamic typing, whitespace, REPL
Zen of python, import == batteries included
Keywords and identifiers
Taking inputs – raw_input; to NOT use input
Assignment operations
Data types – just general idea; flexibility in Python
print statement; NOT function
Arithmetic operations – floating point division
Basic debugging – common errors that can occur and what they mean
Useful built-in functions – len, sum, max, min; list methods, string methods
Give warning about mutability, so list methods not that straightforward; tell at least look into string methods on documentation
Reading documentation
Strings – immutable, indexable, single/double
Possible topic: Conditionals – if else; elif; single line ternary X if Y else Z
Next class assignment? (PYA) Convert a sufficiently complex program you wrote in C/C++/Java to Python
