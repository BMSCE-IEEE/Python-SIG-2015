Assignment questions

1) Write a program that reads two numbers from the user,
   (converting them to integers if they are floating point numbers)
   and then prints their sum along with the user input in this format:
		'enter number 1:' 5.67
		'enter number 2:' 5.67
		'You entered 5.67 and 5.67. Adding 5 and 5, sum is 10'

2) Write a program that takes input  of the form
   'num1,num2,[any one of +-*/]' as a string
   and performs the given operation. In other words, your program is a simple calculator
   which can perform floating point arithmetic.
   Try making improvements like asking for number of decimal digits to be displayed.

3) Input an angle as degrees. And find a trigonometric ratio based on users choice[out of sin, cos and tan].
   Do this 'n' times, where 'n' was entered by the user initially.

4) Input two strings. One  takes in login_ID and other password.
   It prints 'login_ID is successful' if password is 'password'.
   Else should show a fail message and keep prompting user for password.

5) Find the factorial of a given number. Don't import math.
   Try to make your program break and fix all those cases. (recursive vs. iterative)

6) Assume the user is inputting integers only. If the entered integer is odd,
   it returns the sum of all the even integers entered up to that point and exits the program.

7) Write a program which takes a list of alphabets (chars) as input and returns a list of same length
   containing Boolean values as output. The corresponding Boolean value is True iff the char is a vowel.
