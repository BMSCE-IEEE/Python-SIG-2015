Class 4 - 17/10/2015

Brief mention and revision of:
Functions - general syntax, docstrings, scope of variables, global statement

How import works - .py and .pyc files, how we can make our own modules (hint: sys.path)
Functions part 2! - default args, *args and **kwargs

List and String methods -
- basic difference in what they return (None or a modified string)
- Lists - append, extend, remove, pop, reverse, sort

- Strings - split - join, upper - lower, startswith - endswith

- import string for string.whitespace and string.punctuation


Tuples and Dictionaries
Tuples -
- What is a tuple?

- We can only 'count' and 'index' them, why?

- Why use them?
- A tuple is not parentheses, it is commas!

- Related question: How to create a tuple with a single element?

Dictionaries -
- What is a dictionary? Why use them?

- Only immutable objects can be keys

- key, value pairs

- dict methods - mainly: .keys, .values, .items

- for i in dict set i to what?

- .get to prevent KeyError



Exception handling -
- try except else finally

- assert and raise

- except ExceptionName, errorinfo

- How to catch multiple exceptions with a single except?

- with X as Y: to replace try in some cases

Difference between:
try:
	#potentially dangerous code
except (TypeError,KeyError):
	print 'type or key'
except ValueError, err_info:
	print 'value', str(err_info)
